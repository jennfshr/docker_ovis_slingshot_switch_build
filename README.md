This is a rather simple implementation of a docker build and run invocation on a Macintosh Apple M2 Max.

No positional parameters are supplied to the script, but it will prompt for a docker username and password to authenticate to the docker registry.

The successful execution of the script will output the following execution trace of the docker build steps and a print statement directing the user to the resulting tarball on their desktop.
